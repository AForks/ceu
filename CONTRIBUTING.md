(It only requires the user/password to avoid SPAM.)

## Manual

The manual is in the main repository of Céu on github:

https://github.com/fsantanna/ceu/tree/master/manual

## Website and On-line Tutorial

http://www.ceu-lang.org/

http://www.ceu-lang.org/try.php

The website with the tutorial is also available on github:

https://github.com/fsantanna/ceu-site/

I believe it only requires Linux+Apache+PHP to run.
