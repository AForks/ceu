<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Céu provides <em>Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming</em> which supports
safe and deterministic concurrency with side effects.
The lines of execution in Céu, known as <em>trails</em>, react together continuously
and in synchronous steps to external input events from the environment.
Waiting for an event halts the running trail until that event occurs.
The environment broadcasts an occurring event to all active trails, which share 
a single global time reference.</p>
<p>The synchronous concurrency model of Céu diverges from multithreading and also
from actor-based models (e.g. <em>pthreads</em> and <em>erlang</em>).
On the one hand, there is no real parallelism at the synchronous kernel of the
language (i.e., no multi-core execution).
On the other hand, trails can share variables deterministically without
synchronization primitives (i.e., no <em>locks</em>, <em>semaphores</em>, or <em>queues</em>).</p>
<p>Céu provides automatic memory management based on static lexical scopes (i.e.,
no <em>free</em> or <em>delete</em>) and does not require runtime garbage collection.</p>
<p>Céu integrates safely with C, and programs can define and make native calls
seamlessly while avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers.</p>
<p>Céu is <a href="#license">free software</a>.</p>
<h2 id="synchronous-execution-model">Synchronous Execution Model</h2>
<p>Céu is grounded on a precise definition of <em>logical time</em> (as opposed to
<em>physical</em> or <em>wall-clock time</em>) as a discrete sequence of external input
events:
a sequence because only a single input event is handled at a logical time; 
discrete because reactions to events are guaranteed to execute in bounded
physical time (see <a href="#bounded-execution">Bounded Execution</a>).</p>
<p>The execution model for Céu programs is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program initiates the <em>boot reaction</em> from the first line of code in a
      single trail.</li>
<li>Active trails<sup>1</sup>, one after another, execute until they await or 
      terminate.
      This step is named a <em>reaction chain</em>, and always runs in bounded time.</li>
<li>The program goes idle and the environment takes control.</li>
<li>On the occurrence of a new external input event, the environment awakes 
      <em>all</em> trails awaiting that event.
      It then goes to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<sup>1</sup>
<em>Trails can be created with <a href="#parallel-compositions-and-abortion">parallel 
compositions</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>The synchronous execution model of Céu is based on the hypothesis that reaction
chains run <em>infinitely faster</em> in comparison to the rate of external events.
A reaction chain is the set of computations that execute when an external 
event occurs.
Conceptually, a program takes no time on step 2 and is always idle on step 3.
In practice, if a new external input event occurs while a reaction chain is 
running (step 2), it is enqueued to run in the next reaction.
When multiple trails are active at a logical time (i.e. awaking from the same 
event), Céu schedules them in the order they appear in the program text.
This policy is somewhat arbitrary, but provides a priority scheme for trails, 
and also ensures deterministic and reproducible execution for programs.
At any time, at most one trail is executing.</p>
<p>The program and diagram below illustrate the behavior of the scheduler of Céu:</p>
<pre><code> 1:  <b>input void</b> A, B, C;
 2:  <b>par/and do</b>           // A, B, and C are external input events
 3:      // trail 1
 4:      &lt;...&gt;            // &lt;...&gt; represents non-awaiting statements
 5:      <b>await</b> A;
 6:      &lt;...&gt;
 7:  <b>with</b>
 8:      // trail 2
 9:      &lt;...&gt;
10:      <b>await</b> B;
11:      &lt;...&gt;
12:  <b>with</b>
13:      // trail 3
14:      &lt;...&gt;
15:      <b>await</b> A;
16:      &lt;...&gt;
17:      <b>await</b> B;
18:      <b>par/and do</b>
19:          // trail 3
20:          &lt;...&gt;
21:      <b>with</b>
22:          // trail 4
23:          &lt;...&gt;
24:      <b>end</b>
25:  <b>end</b>
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="" src="../reaction.png" /></p>
<p>The program starts in the boot reaction and forks into three trails.
Respecting the lexical order of declaration for the trails, they are scheduled
as follows (<em>t0</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-1</em> executes up to the <code>await A</code> (line 5);</li>
<li><em>trail-2</em>, up to the <code>await B</code> (line 10);</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em>, up to <code>await A</code> (line 15).</li>
</ul>
<p>As no other trails are pending, the reaction chain terminates and the scheduler 
remains idle until the event <code>A</code> occurs (<em>t1</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-1</em> awakes, executes and terminates (line 6);</li>
<li><em>trail-2</em> remains suspended, as it is not awaiting <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em> executes up to <code>await B</code> (line 17).</li>
</ul>
<p>During the reaction <em>t1</em>, new instances of events <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> occur and
are enqueued to be handled in the reactions in sequence.
As <code>A</code> happened first, it is used in the next reaction.
However, no trails are awaiting it, so an empty reaction chain takes place 
(<em>t2</em> in the diagram).
The next reaction dequeues the event <code>B</code> (<em>t3</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-2</em> awakes, executes and terminates;</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em> splits in two and they both terminate immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>par/and</code> rejoins after all trails terminate.
With all trails terminated, the program also terminates and does not react to 
the pending event <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>Note that each step in the logical time line (<em>t0</em>, <em>t1</em>, etc.) is identified 
by the unique event it handles.
Inside a reaction, trails only react to that identifying event (or remain 
suspended).</p>
<!--
A reaction chain may also contain emissions and reactions to internal events, 
which are presented in Section~\ref{sec.ceu.ints}.
-->

<h3 id="parallel-compositions-and-abortion">Parallel Compositions and Abortion</h3>
<p>The use of trails in parallel allows programs to wait for multiple events at 
the same time.
Céu supports three kinds of parallel compositions that differ in how they
rejoin and proceed to the statement in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>a <code>par/and</code> rejoins after all trails in parallel terminate;</li>
<li>a <code>par/or</code> rejoins after any trail in parallel terminates, aborting all
   other trails;</li>
<li>a <code>par</code> never rejoins, even if all trails terminate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The termination of a trail inside a <code>par/or</code> aborts the other trails in 
parallel which are necessarily idle
(see <a href="#synchronous-execution-model"><code>rule 2</code> for external reactions</a>).
Before being aborted, a trail has a last opportunity to execute active 
<a href="#finalization">finalization statements</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction and emphasized in the execution model, trails
in parallel do not execute with real parallelism.
Therefore, parallel compositions should read as <em>awaiting in parallel</em>, rather
than <em>executing in parallel</em>.</p>
<h3 id="bounded-execution">Bounded Execution</h3>
<p>Reaction chains must run in bounded time to guarantee that programs are 
responsive and can handle upcoming input events from the environment.
For this reason, Céu requires every path inside the body of a <code>loop</code> statement
to contain at least one <code>await</code> or <code>break</code> statement.
This prevents <em>tight loops</em>, i.e., unbounded loops that do not await.</p>
<p>In the example below, the true branch of the <code>if</code> may never execute, resulting
in a tight loop when the condition is false:</p>
<pre><code><b>loop do</b>
    <b>if</b> &lt;cond&gt; <b>then</b>
        <b>break</b>;
    <b>end</b>
<b>end</b>
</code></pre>

<p>Céu complains about tight loops in programs at compile time.
For time-consuming algorithms that require unrestricted loops (e.g., 
cryptography, image processing), Céu provides <a href="#asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous 
Execution</a>.</p>
<h3 id="deterministic-execution">Deterministic Execution</h3>
<p><code>TODO (shared memory + deterministic scheduler + optional static analysis)</code></p>
<h3 id="internal-reactions">Internal Reactions</h3>
<p>Céu supports inter-trail communication through <code>await</code> and <code>emit</code> statements
for <em>internal events</em>.
A trail can <code>emit</code> an event which is broadcast to the program to awake trails
in parallel that are blocked in an <code>await</code> statement for that same event.</p>
<p>An <code>emit</code> starts a new <em>internal reaction</em> in the program relying on a
runtime stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <code>emit</code> suspends the current trail and its continuation is pushed into the
    stack (i.e., the statement in sequence with the <code>emit</code>).</li>
<li>All trails awaiting the emitted event awake and execute
    (see <a href="#synchronous-execution-model"><code>rule 2</code> for external reactions</a>).</li>
<li>The top of stack is popped and the last emitting trail resumes execution
    from its continuation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if an awaking trail emits another internal event (in <code>rule 2</code>), a
nested internal reaction starts (in <code>rule 1</code>).
Example:</p>
<pre><code>1:  <b>par/and do</b>
2:      <b>await</b> e;
3:      <b>emit</b> f;
4:  <b>with</b>
5:      <b>await</b> f;
6:  <b>with</b>
7:      ...
8:      <b>emit</b> e;
9:  <b>end</b>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>emit e</code> in <em>trail-3</em> (line 8) starts an internal reaction that awakes the 
<code>await e</code> in <em>trail-1</em> (line 2).
Then, the <code>emit f</code> (line 3) starts another internal reaction that awakes the 
<code>await f</code> in <em>trail-2</em> (line 5).
<em>Trail-2</em> terminates and the <code>emit f</code> resumes in <em>trail-1</em>.
<em>Trail-1</em> terminates and the <code>emit e</code> resumes in <em>trail-3</em>.
<em>Trail-3</em> terminates.
Finally, the <code>par/and</code> rejoins and the program terminates.</p></div>
