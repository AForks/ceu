Céu is a reactive language targeted at embedded systems, aiming to offer a 
higher-level and safer alternative to C.

This "standalone" distribution is intended to be used for the development of 
Céu itself.
As a kick-off, try running the following on the command line:

$ ./run_tests

For Céu distributions targeted at specific platforms (e.g. Arduino), consult 
the website.
